About CSGO Trade
=====

CSGO Trade is a project of mine (Jonco). I've been wanting to start this for about a month, but cannot find the right people who know what they're doing. I have a domain and a host, just do not know how to run a website.

The idea of CSGO trade is to have a live chat where people can buy/sell their CSGO items in real time. Instead of making a post and waiting until someone see's it, they can join a channel in the chatroom and buy/sell items.
